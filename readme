dew is a new to-do list api.

Add tasks ("drops") to your "to-dew" list on the left side of the screen.

The right side of the screen functions as a calendar. 

You may add "dew dates" to this calendar, each of which functions as another to-dew list.

The main to-dew list is ideal for long-term goals, and dew dates are ideal for time-sensitive tasks. But in the end, what you dew is up to you!
